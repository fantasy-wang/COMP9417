--- Please add your details on the next two lines.

--------------------------------------------------------------

*** ANSWERS:
---  Please provide answers to each question as specified. Other
---  text will be ignored. Please only uncomment lines containing
---  your answers and do not change any other text. Each multiple-choice
---  question should have exactly ONE answer. Any questions with more than
---  one answer uncommented will receive ZERO marks. For each question
---  your answers should reflect your knowledge of the learning algorithms
---  applied, and any results obtained on datasets used.

--------------------------------------------------------------
*** QUESTION 1  [Total: 3 marks]
--- To answer this question, first run the classifiers and save the
--- output below, then answer the multiple-choice questions below.

*** Question 1(a) [1 mark] 
--- Copy/paste below the output from running the code in the notebook.
--- DO NOT EDIT the table in any way !!!


*** Question 1(b) [1 mark]
--- In sklearn's decision tree learning implementation, the parameter
--- "min_samples_leaf" places a lower bound on the number of training
--- set examples that can appear at any leaf of the decision tree. This
--- data is used during learning to assign a decision to that leaf,
--- e.g., by assigning the leaf to predict the majority class of the
--- training set examples at the leaf. By increasing the value of the
--- "min_samples_leaf" parameter we can expect this to:

--- (1) decrease overfitting by decreasing the number of examples at any leaf
--- (2) decrease overfitting by increasing the number of examples at any leaf
--- (3) increase overfitting by decreasing the number of examples at any leaf
--- (4) increase overfitting by increasing the number of examples at any leaf

*** Question 1(c) [1 mark]
--- We can ask the question: for datasets with medium levels of added
--- noise, has the search to set the value of the "min_samples_leaf"
--- parameter resulted in improved test set accuracy compared to the
--- default parameter settings ?  Looking at the table, we conclude the
--- answer is:

--- (1) no
--- (2) yes, for 1/4 of the datasets
--- (3) yes, for 2/4 of the datasets
--- (4) yes, for 3/4 of the datasets
--- (5) yes, for 4/4 of the datasets


--------------------------------------------------------------
*** QUESTION 2  [Total: 7 marks]

--- For this question you must copy and paste below the code you wrote to
--- complete the implementation of the RNN. Be sure not to introduce
--- any changes from your final code as it ran in the notebook !!!

--- TO DO: setup for the current step  [2 marks]
layer_input =  []
weight = []

--- TO DO: calculate gradients  [1 mark]
gradients, dW, db = [], [], []

--- TO DO: update weights  [2 marks]
self.weights[0] += 0
self.biases[0] += 0

--- TO DO: setup for the next step  [2 marks]
previous_gradients = []
layer_output = []

*** END
